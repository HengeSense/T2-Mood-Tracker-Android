		<h2 id="MainActivity">Main Screen</h2>
		<p>The main screen allows you to perform several functions.  You can <span style="color:#ff0000">Add a Note</span> by touching the icon on the top right corner of the screen.</p>  
		<p>You can also navigate to any of the <span style="color:#ff0000">Rating Categories</span> which include <span style="color:#4444ff">Anxiety, Depression, General Well-Being, Head Injury, Post-traumatic Stress, or Stress</span>.</p>  
		<p>The <span style="color:#ff0000">Results</span> area takes you to graph results which display all of your previous ratings, and allows you to <span style="color:#ff0000">view notes</span> you have previously entered.</p>
		<p>The lower area of the screen provides <span style="color:#ff0000">information</span> about T2 Mood Tracker, gives you with the opportunity to send written <span style="color:#ff0000">feedback</span> about the app directly to the developers, and offers this <span style="color:#ff0000">help</span> information.</p>  
		<p>The <span style="color:#ff0000">Settings</span> area contains a <span style="color:#4444ff">Category Editor</span> which allows you to hide any of the rating categories that may not interest to you.</p>
		<p>You can also set a <span style="color:#4444ff">reminder</span> so you don't forget to make your ratings.  At any point you can <span style="color:#4444ff">clear</span> all of your ratings from any of the categories and clear your notes as well.</p>
		<p>You can also enable <span style="color:#4444ff">security</span> using a PIN and enable or disable the <span style="color:#4444ff">health tips</span> on startup.</p> 
		<p>Knowing how T2 Mood Tracker is being used helps the developers to modify and upgrade the app based on <span style="color:#4444ff">anonymous usage</span> patterns.  This information DOES NOT compromise your personal anonymity in any way.  You may disable this function if you choose, however.</p>
		<p>The last function on the list allows you to tell a friend about the app using an email message which includes download information.</p>

		<h2 id="RateActivity">Rate Your Mood</h2>
		<p>By selecting the mood category you’d like to rate you will see a screen with ten opposing pairs of feeling states like happy-sad.  To rate how you are doing, move the slider with your finger to the place on the scale that best reflects how you are feeling at the moment.</p>  
		<p>Make sure you rate yourself on each of the ten pairs of feelings by scrolling to the very bottom of the screen.  When you have completed your ratings, touch “save” and you will be returned to the main screen.  Your rating will be automatically included on the graph for that mood category.</p>

		<h2 id="GroupResultsActivity">Reviewing Your Results</h2>
		<p>By selecting <span style="color:#ff0000">Graphed Results</span> from the main screen you can view all of your ratings by date.  To view graphs of previous or subsequent months use the arrows beneath the graph.  You can view your results on any combination of mood categories by toggling each one ON or OFF.</p>
		<p>Each point on the graph represents the average of your mood ratings for each of the ten opposing pairs of feeling states for that mood category on a given day.  Downward trends in the graphs represent more positive self-ratings unless the category has been marked as desirable (such as the "General Well-Being" category).</p>
		<img src="file:///android_asset/img/graph_example.png" style="width:300px" />
		<p>You can view your notes by touching <span style="color:#ff0000">Notes.</span>  There is a small triangle shaped indicator on the top of the graph indicating which dates have notes associated with them.  You can add a note for any date by touching “<span style="color:#ff0000">Add a Note</span>” at the top of the screen.</p>
		<p>By touching any of the Mood Category labels (e.g., Anxiety), you can display the graphs of your self-ratings for each of the ten pair of opposing feeling states.  As with the category graphs, you can display or hide each of the graphs by toggling them ON and OFF.</p>
		<p>You can <span style="color:#ff0000">clear your graphs</span> by going to Settings > Clear Result Data</p>

		<h2 id="NotesListActivity">Managing Notes</h2>
		<p>By touching <span style="color:#ff0000">View/Edit Notes</span> on the Main Screen, you can see all of your notes with the most recent note you&#8217;ve made on top.  Any note that has more text than is displayed has an indicator alerting you that there is additional text.  By touching the note, the full text is displayed and the keyboard is made available to edit the note if desired.  You can also create a new note from this screen.  You can <span style="color:#ff0000">clear your notes</span> by going to Settings > Clear Result</p>
		<a href="#index">Back to Index</a>
		
		<h2 id="GroupListActivity">Creating Custom Categories</h2>
		<p>You can <span style="color:#ff0000">create a custom self-rating category</span> by going to Settings > Groups on the main screen.  Touch the + in the upper right hand corner of the screen.  You can <span style="color:#ff0000">name your new category</span> and then touch <span style="color:#ff0000">Manage Scales</span>.  You will be able to name to name opposing descriptors for that category.   The left label should represent the “negative” feeling and the right label, the “positive” feeling. You can make as many custom categories as you like.</p>
